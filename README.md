# RFM Segmentation

RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segmentation is a powerful analytical technique used to classify customers based on their purchasing habits. By analyzing how recently a customer made a purchase, how often they buy, and how much they spend, businesses can gain deeper insights into customer behavior and value. This approach supports personalized marketing strategies and enhances customer relationship management by identifying key customer segments.

## Why we should go through in this process

RFM segmentation calculates recency, frequency, and monetary scores for each customer and classifies them into specific categories based on these metrics. Using the provided SQL script, customers are grouped into segments such as 'Churned Customer', 'Slipping Away Customer', 'Cannot Lose Customer', 'New Customers', 'Potential Churners Customer', 'Active Customer', and 'Loyal Customer' enabling a targeted approach to customer management and retention.


## Database Setup

- Create a database named `RFM_SALES`.
```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS RFM_SALES;
USE RFM_SALES;
CREATE TABLE SALES_SAMPLE_DATA (
    ORDER_NUMBER INT(8),
    QUANTITY_ORDERED DECIMAL(8,2),
    PRICE_EACH DECIMAL(8,2),
    ORDER_LINENUMBER INT(3),
    SALES DECIMAL(8,2),
    ORDER_DATE VARCHAR(16),
    STATUS VARCHAR(16),
    QTR_ID INT(1),
    MONTH_ID INT(2),
    YEAR_ID INT(4),
    PRODUCT_LINE VARCHAR(32),
    MSRP INT(8),
    PRODUCT_CODE VARCHAR(16),
    CUSTOMER_NAME VARCHAR(64),
    PHONE VARCHAR(32),
    ADDRESS_LINE1 VARCHAR(64),
    ADDRESS_LINE2 VARCHAR(64),
    CITY VARCHAR(16),
    STATE VARCHAR(16),
    POSTAL_CODE VARCHAR(16),
    COUNTRY VARCHAR(24),
    TERRITORY VARCHAR(24),
    CONTACT_LASTNAME VARCHAR(16),
    CONTACT_FIRSTNAME VARCHAR(16),
    DEAL_SIZE VARCHAR(10)
);
```
